# Study on world water development
#### Technical Skills: Excel, Tableau, Figma, PowerPoint, Word

For this project, I played the part of a data analyst working for the NGO “Drinking Water For ALL’ (DWFA), which has the goal of providing access to safe drinking water to everyone worldwide. 

DWFA has three areas of expertise
-	Creation of drinking water services
-	Modernisation of existing water services
-	Consulting with governments regarding water access policies.

The organisation made a request for funding from a donor by presenting these 3 areas of expertise. The donor will make a choice of which area of expertise he wishes to choose, but will only choose one. I was tasked with creating three tableau dashboards (a global, a regional, and a national view) to allow the DWFA to determine which countries to target, based on the area of expertise chosen by the donor.
