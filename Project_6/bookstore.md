# Sales analysis for an online book seller
#### Technical Skills: Excel, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy), PowerPoint

For this project, I played the role of a data analyst working for a book seller called Lapage. Lapage was originally a physical bookstore with several points of sale, but due to strong sales and the enthusiasm of its customers, two years ago it decided to make a website and sell products there as well. 

They now wanted to take stock of the company's various indicators and key figures. This would then allow them to decide on future strategies - for example, to decide if they should create certain offers, adapt certain prices or target a certain type of clientele etc.

The analysis was devided into two parts:
- An analysis of different sales indicators (for example, evolution of revenue, sales of product categories, top 10 customers etc.)
- A statistical analysis identifying the correlation between client demographics and categories of books bought, total basket prices, and number of purchases.
