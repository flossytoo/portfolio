![Ecommerce sales analysis cover page](../images_english/P2.png)

#### Technical skills - Excel, PowerPoint

For this project, I played the role of a junior data analyst working for an ecommerce platform selling a variety of products. The company manages a warehouse and delivers orders placed by customers on its website to homes. This project required me to work on a monthly report about sales and marketing, and consisting of 2 parts.

For the 1st part, I was asked to select 5 graphs between a variety of pre-generated graphs in order to present information on:
- the proportion of sales by product category;
- the amount of customer purchases (basket amount);
- evolution of revenue, sales numbers, ratio of number of purchases by number of website visits, number of visits to our website, and time spent on our website
- variability of time spent on our website
- likely future evolution of revenue
    
In addition, I was asked to explain where the drop in turnover comes from and how the situation would evolve in the coming months.

For the second part of the project, I was asked to work in Excel to update revenue figs, add the most recent month's data, and:
- Create 4 graphs in the dashboard sheet,
- Update the first chart (already created) with the most recent month's data
- Create a table which summarizes for each customer, the number of purchases and the total turnover in Sheet 2
