# Detection of fake banknotes using machine learning

#### Technical Skills: Excel, Python libraries (ScikitLearn, Statsmodels, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Plotly), PowerPoint

For this project, I played the part of a Data Analyst consultant, and helped the National Organisation for the Fight against Counterfeiting. The organisation had noticed there is a difference in terms of dimensions between real and counterfeit banknotes and so asked me to develop an algorithm to detect counterfeit banknotes based on these dimensions.

The organisation asked to not only see the results of the algorithm but the treatments and analysis that I carried out in order to identify the best model. They also requested that I use a linear regression to treat missing data in the 'margin_low' column (a column with the size of the margin on the bottom of banknotes).

I was also requsted to use k-means and logistic regression as potential models for detecting counterfeit banknotes. I ultimately tested two types of logistic rgression (ScikitLearn's and Statsmodels), as well as k-means.
