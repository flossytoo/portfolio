# Market research for a food company looking to expand internationally
#### Technical Skills: Excel, Python libraries (ScikitLearn, Scipy, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Plotly), PowerPoint

For this project, I played the part of a data analyst working for a French food business focussed on selling chicken products. The business was successful and looking to expand internationally, but was unsure of what regions and countries would be best to target for international expansion. 

In order to thoroughly investigate this topic, I used data which allowed me to do a PESTEL analysis, and merged datasets together. I then performed hierarchical ascending classification, k-means clustering and a principal component analysis in order to identify pertinent countries. 

Based on this analysis, I was able to identify that Australasia (particularly Australia and New Zealand), and Europe (particularly the Netherlands and Ireland) would be the best regions to target.
