# Creation of a database for real estate data with SQL
#### Technical skills: Excel, draw.io, PowerQuery, SQLite, Word

For this project, I played the role of a data analyst working for "Laplace Immo" - a national network of real estate companies.

The general director believes that the agency must attempt to stand out from the competition by creating a model to better predict the sale price of real estate.

He therefore asked me to work on the “DATAImmo” project. This project involves modifying a database to allow for the collection of data on real estate and land transactions in France.

Following this, I was asked to conduct an analysis of the real estate market of France to allow regional agencies to better support their clients.

In this context, I was asked to create a database to collect real estate and land transactions in France. The company was then able to use the database to analyse the market and help the different regional agencies to better support their clients.

I was provided with 3 csv files for this project:
- data extracted from the open data site for Land Value Requests (DVF);
- data from INSEE with the results of population censuses;
- data from data.gouv on the regions, with the French geographical reference, municipalities, urban units, urban areas, departments, academies, regions.

The project involved
- Preparation of a data dictionary for each csv file
- Creation of a database schema in order to guide the development of the new database
- Creation of the new database in SQLite
- Analysis of real estate data in SQLite
