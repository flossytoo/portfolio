# Analysis of a company's gender equality indicators
#### Technical Skills: Excel, KNIME, Figma, PowerPoint, Word

For this project, I played the role of a data analyst in a consulting firm specializing in the digital transformation of companies. The firm already had more than 150 employees and was continuing to expand. In this economic context, strategic recruiting of experienced consultants was of importance to the company.

In addition, in France companies with 50+ employees must produce a yearly gender equality index and publish it online. I was tasked with creating a diagnostic report on gender equality within the company, both to fufill legal requirements, but also to help in developing a proactive policy towards developing gender equality in the business to help to more easily attract talent.

I was therefore asked to use KNIME, an open source data analysis tool, to prepare a workflow with graphs for various equality indicators, and a csv file ready to use for any future analysis, and then report of findings from analysis of the equality indicators.
